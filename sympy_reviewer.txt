# SymPy Pull Request Manager (below referred simply as Manager)

Pay rate: $10/hour

Responsibilities:

* The primary responsibility of the Manager is to ensure that SymPy Pull
  Requests (PRs) get reviewed quickly and get either merged or rejected in a
  timely manner.

* When somebody submits a PR, the Manager will try find an
  appropriate reviewer and ask him to review the PR. The Manager will stay on
  top, and if the reviewer can't review in a timely fashion, the Manager will
  find another reviewer or review the PR himself.

* If PR authors need help with technical issues such as rebasing or making sure
  the tests pass, the Manager should try to help, or find somebody who can help.

* The Manager will also go over stalled (old) PRs, and see what needs to be
  done to finish them, and either ask the author to finish it, find a reviewer,
  or close the PR (by creating an issue with a link to the closed PR and a list
  of things that need to be done in order to finish it).

* Additional responsibilities might include helping with the SymPy release
  process (improving automation or even making the release)

* Expected to work around 5h/week, preferably work at least 30 min each day, or
  1h every other day if possible.

* Report hours each week, together with a brief description what was done.

* Report to Ondřej Čertík

* Either side can decide for any reason at any time to quit the arrangement
