Work done
=========

* Followed past conversation of PR's [#12970](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/12970), [#12741](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/12741), [#12567](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/12567), PR's related to SymEngine backend and polite pinged accordingly to address the changes.

* Looked over PR [#13339](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/13339).

No PR got merged, but that's not to worry about. It's the beginning and I am keeping track of on which PR's I have pinged people and which PR's still require mentor attention, which are having current ongoing conversation. Though currently on a small list, when pinged people do get back on them I'll ping the respective mentor or address them accordingly (individually). Just hope all the pinged don't respond at the same time concurrently.
