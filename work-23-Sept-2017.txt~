Work Done
=========

* Major PR's reviewed/merged: #12491, #12029, #13335.
* Closed longstanding unresponsive PR (from author's side) #13165.
* Tagged recently opened PR's.


Decision made
=============

(For beginner authors) The pull requests on which I have pinged the author to address merge conflicts and to ask for help if need to be. In those cases if the author doesn't respond in any way in 1 week or so I'll close the corresponding PR with a 'respectful' message.

I've listed them on my local computer, so I could get to them having time-stamp > 1 week.

Note: this is done in cases where PR has been there for more than a few months.

Query
=====

For pull requests related to solvers module (particularly solveset), in those cases even the 'solvers-team' hasn't responded positively, and I don't want to get into reviewing the solvers module myself (it's quite a tricky module I feel). What be done in cases like that?


Time spent
==========

1 hour 30 minutes
